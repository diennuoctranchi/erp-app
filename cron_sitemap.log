Association Tracking for PaperTrail has been extracted to a separate gem. To use it, please add `paper_trail-association_tracking` to your Gemfile. If you don't use it (most people don't, that's the default) and you set `track_associations = false` somewhere (probably a rails initializer) you can remove that line now.
